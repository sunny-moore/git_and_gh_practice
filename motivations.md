# What Motivates Me
I started my professional journey late in life, after the death of my husband 5 years ago... At the time, if felt like I was starting my life over at a huge disadvantage, as a single mom who didn't finish college.  It seemed like the rest of my life would be scrabbling in the rat race to just stay even, and I wanted so much more than that for my future.  However, I didn't know how I could make my dream of having a better work/life balance, being able to focus on my family and experiences that would enrich us while still making enough money to live.  This is what drives me now that there is a potential career that could make those dreams a reality.
